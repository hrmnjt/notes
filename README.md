# Notes

Git backed private encrypted note-taking. Awesomeness coming soon!

Context:
A quick and dirty implementation of the project can be found in the [`release-0.1.0`](https://github.com/hrmnjt/notes/tree/release-0.1.0) branch. I'm as of now re-designing the approach for notes, not loosing the initial essence/motivation. The primary idea is two fold:
- fork the repo and start writing notes
- multiple options for making notes secure and private

## Documentation

Documentation for the project is done using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and is located in [docs](#) folder.
TODO: add details for guided docs
