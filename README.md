# Notes

Git backed private encrypted note-taking. Awesomeness coming soon!

Context:
A quick and dirty implementation of the project can be found in the `release-0.1.0` branch. I'm as of now re-designing the approach for notes, not loosing the initial essence/motivation. The primary idea is two fold:
- fork the repo and start writing notes
- multiple options for making notes secure and private

TODO: add links for `release-0.1.0` branch

## Documentation

Documentation for the project is done using [Sphinx]() and is located in [docs]() folder.
TODO: add details for guided docs
