Motivation
==========

Looking into the world of note-taking applications, there are several and each
one brings a new feature into consideration. There are very few which are not
commercial and among the few open-source ones, privacy is a concern.

If a note-taking application could do the following, it would be very
convinient for developers and programmers

* open-source code base
* storage is independent of providers
* excellent tooling to write notes
* private notes, even if storage is public

Just starting out with these pointers, there are very limited options available
right now.

Available options
-----------------

Listing the issues with the available options for note taking applications

* Notion - freemium
* Typora - beta; stable version will be paid
* Quiver - paid
* Bear notes - paid

Few of the note taking apps that are worth trying out:

* Boostnote
* Cherrytree
* Stackedit
* Onenote

Let's try these options and find out if there is something that can suit our
need.
